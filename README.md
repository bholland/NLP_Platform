NLP Platform
Apache based NLP platform with database integration

# Introduction
This is a general platform for NLP work and research. Abt Associates
funded the inital research to start this platform. There are
too many moving pieces to this particular project for a short readme.
Formal documentation is forthcoming.

A short exaplanation is that this application accepts many file formats,
processes the text using standard NLP piplines, and stores results in a
database. It also has further post processing capeabilities that are so far,
non-standard.

As a personal note, I would like to personally thank all of the staff
at Abt Assocaites that made this application possible. I hope we take it
and run. Thank you.
