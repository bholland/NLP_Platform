Readme:

The Managed Unix Projects folder contains all of the project specifications. Here, each file
is a content processing engine (CPE). The UIMA component descriptor editor (the nice UI)
does not have a UI for the CPE. Under the source tab and the XML view, you define the two
pieces of a project. The first piece defines an iterator and the second piece defines the set
of descriptors.
